# 🚀 MERN JWT-Based Login System

Hey there! 👋  
This project demonstrates a secure login system built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication. It covers user login with token-based security, backend validation, and protected routes.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ User login with email and password  
✅ Secure password validation and hashing  
✅ JWT token generation and verification  
✅ Protected backend routes accessible only with valid JWT  
✅ Client-side token storage and usage for authenticated API calls  
✅ Simple React frontend with login form and error handling  

---

## 📦 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
````

Run this in both frontend and backend folders if separated.

---

### 2️⃣ Start the backend server

```bash
npm run server
```

This will start your Express backend on the configured port (e.g., 5000).

---

### 3️⃣ Start the frontend dev server

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and head to 👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
